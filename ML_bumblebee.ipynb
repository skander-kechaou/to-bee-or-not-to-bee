    "* Context : Pollinator insects such as bees and bumblebees are important for ecosystems diversity and by fertilizing flowers, they play a vital role in the global food chain system.\n",
    "* Problem : Distinguishing bee types amongst pollinators is crucial in this context and traditional methods which are mostly manual are quite time-consuming especially with our dataset of 250 images, although it might be less prone to error\n",
    "* Solution : This project aims to leverage Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning and Ai & Optimization techniques to automate the identification process by looking at an image (and its mask) and recognize the bug type and in a later time its species.\n",
    "* Stakeholders : This project would interest more than one amongst researches, within the agricultural sector as well as for educational purposes."
